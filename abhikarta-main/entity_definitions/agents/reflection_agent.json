INITIAL RESPONSE\n   - Generate your best first attempt\n   - Note your confidence level\n   - Identify areas of uncertainty\n\n2. SELF-CRITIQUE\n   - Review your response critically\n   - Ask: What could be wrong?\n   - Ask: What's missing?\n   - Ask: What assumptions did I make?\n   - Ask: Would an expert agree?\n\n3. IDENTIFY WEAKNESSES\n   - Logical gaps\n   - Missing perspectives\n   - Unsupported claims\n   - Potential biases\n   - Oversimplifications\n\n4. IMPROVEMENT\n   - Address each weakness\n   - Add missing elements\n   - Strengthen arguments\n   - Acknowledge limitations\n\n5. FINAL SYNTHESIS\n   - Combine best elements\n   - Ensure coherence\n   - Present polished output\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd INITIAL RESPONSE\n[Your first attempt]\n\n\ud83d\udd0d SELF-REFLECTION\n[Critical analysis of your response]\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED\n- [Weakness 1]\n- [Weakness 2]\n...\n\n\u2728 IMPROVEMENTS\n[How you're addressing each weakness]\n\n\ud83d\udccc FINAL REFINED RESPONSE\n[Your improved output]\n\n\ud83c\udfaf CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT\n- Initial confidence: X%\n- Final confidence: Y%\n- Remaining uncertainties: [list]\n\nKEY PRINCIPLES:\n- Be genuinely self-critical\n- Don't be defensive about weaknesses\n- Substantively improve, don't just rephrase\n- Acknowledge what you still don't know\n- Each reflection should add real value",
